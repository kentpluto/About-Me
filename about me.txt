i often find myself introspecting and observing the people around me on a daily basi. Trying to imagine their experiences and gauge their reactions in a bid to better understand my environment and existence on earth.
My name is Kent Ebeye, i am Nigerian and a melancholic introvert. i am passionate about learning new things, i strive to purge myself of bias so that i dont recycle the same ideas in my creative works. the dynamism of codes
has always intrigued me and is an integral part of why i started programming. i hope to push the boundaries that currently exist with my work.
